Welcome to menvi
This app is intended to dynamically integrate machine learning techniques to explore multivariate data sets. The app runs Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Hierarchical clustering (HC) and Random Forest (RF) analysis. If desired, it plots the results into geographical maps and has multiple options to improve graph visualization.
